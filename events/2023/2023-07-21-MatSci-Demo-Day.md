materials science demo day aspires to be an inclusive opportunity for the materials scientists to showcase their work with the materials science community. each week we convene to hear about the most recent developments in open materials science; we'll span topics of open source, open science, and open research.

demos/presentations/lightning talks/shares are typically 5-10 minutes long. please contact the organizers if you'd like some more time to present your your work. as we begin this event series, we are very open to topics, and will permit impromptu shares if time permits. we do prefer
