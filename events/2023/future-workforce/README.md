This event is open to all, but the primary goal is to hear from young people because this is their future. 

## About the event

The Materials Genome Foundation is forming an open science strategic plan for materials science disciplines. A priority for the foundation is to foster a culture of open materials science community collaborations. As we draft our vision, we want to hear from the people immediately impacted by a changing materials landscape. 

The last decade of vigilant advocacy for digital materials innovation has ushered in a new information rich materials economy. Future materials science efforts require new skills, education, and roadmaps to participate, materials science work will be different than it has been. This new work rests on the shoulders of early career researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Our new materials system ecosystem requires buy-in from the future. We want to hear how y’all envision to future of materials science research, jobs, and education.
